## Overview
This is the backend API for the Recipe Blog, built using Django and Django REST Framework. It handles CRUD operations for recipes, including images and formatted blog content.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd recipe-blog-backend
   ```

2. **Virtual Environment Setup:**

   Itâ€™s highly recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects.

   **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

   **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create and Configure the `.env` File:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   DEBUG=True
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost
   ```

---

## Migrations and Database Setup

1. **Apply Migrations:**
   Run the following commands to set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Load Seed Data (Optional):**
   If you have fixture data, load it using:
   ```bash
   python manage.py loaddata recipes.json
   ```

---

## Running the Server

1. **Run the Django Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

---

## Available Endpoints

Here is a list of the key API endpoints:

- **GET /api/recipes/**: Get all recipes.
- **GET /api/recipes/:id/**: Get a single recipe by ID.
- **POST /api/recipes/**: Create a new recipe.
- **PUT /api/recipes/:id/**: Update an existing recipe.
- **DELETE /api/recipes/:id/**: Delete a recipe.

For more details, refer to the `api/urls.py` file.

## Project Structure

Here is a brief overview of the main directories:

- **`api/`**: Contains the Django app for managing recipes.
- **`config/`**: Contains project settings and configuration files.
- **`media/recipe_images/`**: Stores uploaded recipe images.
- **`fixtures/`**: Contains seed data for the project (optional).

## Environment Variables

The backend uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive data and configuration settings. Ensure it includes:

```
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost
```
